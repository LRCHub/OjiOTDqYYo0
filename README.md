[00:08.02] Wise men say
[00:14.53] Only fools rush in
[00:22.15] But I can't help
[00:28.10] Falling in love with you
[00:40.10] 
[00:37.01] Shall I stay?
[00:44.04] Would it be a sin
[00:50.90] If I can't help
[00:56.64] Falling in love with you?
[01:09.14] 
[01:05.32] Like a river flows
[01:08.87] Surely to the sea
[01:12.71] Darling, so it goes
[01:16.54] Some things are meant to be
[01:30.04] 
[01:23.52] Take my hand
[01:29.53] Take my whole life too
[01:37.51] For I can't help
[01:42.84] Falling in love with you
[01:54.84] 
[01:51.98] Like a river flows
[01:55.10] Surely to the sea
[01:59.28] Darling, so it goes
[02:01.58] Some things are meant to be
[02:15.08] 
[02:09.35] Take my hand
[02:15.44] Take my whole life too
[02:23.20] For I can't help
[02:29.04] Falling in love with you
[02:41.04] 
[02:37.71] For I can't help
[02:43.09] Falling in love with you
